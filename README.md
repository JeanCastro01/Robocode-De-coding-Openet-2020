# De/Coding Openet

De/Coding Openet is open to all third-level students looking to show up and show off their coding and problem-solving skills. The idea behind the event is to build robots using Robocode software to compete against other teams. I had the pleasure of participating, and my team won for having the best code structure in this incredible competition.
